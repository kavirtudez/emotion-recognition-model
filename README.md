# 🧠 Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) with CNN-LSTM

Trained on FER-2013 Dataset | Accuracy: \~84%

## 📌 Overview

Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) uses computer vision to identify emotions from human facial expressions. This project implements a hybrid **CNN-LSTM** model trained on the **FER-2013** dataset to classify 7 basic emotions.

### 🔍 Emotions Recognized

* Angry
* Disgust
* Fear
* Happy
* Sad
* Surprise
* Neutral

## 🧠 Model Architecture

```
Input (48x48x1)
↓
CNN Layers (spatial features)
↓
Flatten & Reshape
↓
Bidirectional LSTM (temporal patterns)
↓
Dense Layers
↓
Softmax (7 classes)
```

### Why CNN-LSTM?

* **CNN** extracts spatial features from facial structures.
* **LSTM** captures sequential dependencies from flattened image features.
* **Together**, they improve emotion classification performance.
